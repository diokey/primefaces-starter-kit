# Primefaces-Starter-Kit

A Starter Kit to get you up and running with Primefaces 5.0 and JSF 2.0.
This project includes **minimal** libraries required to start using Primefaces.
Namely :
  1. JSF 2.0
  2. Primefaces 5.0

If you are using Eclipse, go ahead and download [JBoss Tools](http://tools.jboss.org/downloads/jbosstools/index.html). It will make your life easier.


This ready to import into Eclipse (Eclipse Luna recommended), however I highly recommend using a build system like maven or graddle
